# Harry Potter Coding Challenge

Please use `npm run dev` to run this project in dev mode.

Next steps would be:

Enhancing UI/UX in general like:
 - Adding new ways to navigate through components
 - Add ways to add to favorite on the list itself not only on the details page
 - Adding more interactivity and effects upon hovering or clicking
 - Adding ARIA tags for screen reader capabilities
